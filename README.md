# üèÜ Champion Trading Bot - Live BTC/USDT Trader

This repository contains the code for a fully-automated, live trading bot for the BTC/USDT pair on Binance.US. The bot implements the "Champion Strategy," which was the winning strategy selected from a comprehensive 1-year backtest comparing four different algorithmic approaches.

The bot is designed for production deployment on a cloud platform like Railway and includes features for real-time execution, market adaptation, risk management, and monitoring.

## ü•á The Champion Strategy

The core logic is based on a weekly-rebuilt Markov Chain model combined with key technical indicators. This strategy proved to be the most profitable and robust during a 1-year backtest period (Oct 2024 - Jun 2025).

### Backtest Performance Highlights
- **Total Return:** `+74.04%`
- **Alpha vs. Buy & Hold:** `+12.35%`
- **Annualized Return:** `+131.5%`
- **Win Rate:** `78.5%` over 3,004 trades
- **Sharpe Ratio:** `2.11`

### Core Strategy Parameters
- **Position Sizing:** 25% of available capital per trade.
- **Stop Loss:** 8% below entry price for all long positions.
- **Market Adaptation:** The core transition matrix is rebuilt every 168 hours (1 week) using the last 1000 hours of market data, allowing the bot to continuously adapt to changing market conditions.
- **Trading Signals:** A combination of Markov state prediction (with a >70% confidence threshold) and technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, 200-period EMA, ATR) generates buy/sell signals.

## üöÄ Deployment & Configuration

This bot is designed to be deployed as a `worker` service on a platform like Railway.

### 1. Prerequisites
- A `Binance.US` account.
- Python 3.10+
- The required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### 2. Environment Variables
You must configure the following environment variables in your deployment environment (e.g., in the Railway "Variables" tab):

| Variable              | Description                                                                                             | Example                        |

| `TRADING_SYMBOL`      | The trading pair. Defaults to `BTC/USDT`.                                                               | `BTC/USDT`                     |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | (Optional) A Discord webhook URL for receiving real-time trade notifications and alerts.                | `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...` |
| `SANDBOX_MODE`        | (Optional) Set to `true` to run in sandbox mode (if supported by exchange). Defaults to `false`.        | `false`                        |

#### API Key Permissions
When creating your `Binance.US` API key, ensure the following permissions are set:
- **IP Access:** "Unrestricted" (Required for dynamic cloud platforms).
- **Permissions:**
    - ‚úÖ Enable Spot & Margin Trading
    - ‚ùå Enable Withdrawals (For security, this should be disabled).

### 3. Railway Setup
1.  Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  Create a new project on Railway and link it to your forked repository.
3.  In the project settings, go to the "Variables" tab and add the environment variables listed above.
4.  The `railway.json` and `Procfile` in this repository will automatically configure the bot to run as a `worker` process. A new deployment will be triggered automatically on every `git push`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Bot Operation & Monitoring

### Logging
The bot produces detailed logs to a file (`champion_bot.log`) and to `stdout` (which will appear in Railway's log viewer). The logs provide real-time insight into:
- Portfolio state
- Signal generation logic
- Trade executions
- Stop-loss checks
- Weekly matrix rebuilds

### Discord Notifications
If the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is configured, the bot will send real-time alerts for:
- Bot startup and shutdown events.
- Successful BUY and SELL trades.
- Stop-loss executions.
- Critical errors.

### Emergency Shutdown
The bot can be stopped gracefully by sending a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signal (e.g., by stopping the deployment in Railway, or using `Ctrl+C` if running locally). This will trigger an emergency shutdown handler.
